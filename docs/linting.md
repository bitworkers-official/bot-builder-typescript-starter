# Linting & formatting

This project uses ESLint, and Prettier to catch errors and fix code style.

## Terminal

```bash
# Lint all files, fixing many violations automatically
npm run lint
```

## Pre-commit

Staged files are automatically linted and tested before each commit. See `lint-staged.config.js` to update.
